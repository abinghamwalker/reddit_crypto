    "# Final Report: Analyzing Reddit Sentiment vs. Crypto Price\n",
    " \n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "This project investigates the relationship between cryptocurrency price movements and the sentiment of discussions on Reddit. The primary objective is to determine if a quantifiable signal exists in social media chatter that can be used to understand or predict market behavior for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Methodology Overview\n",
    "A full data pipeline was constructed to:\n",
    "    1.  **Acquire** raw hourly market data and relevant Reddit posts.\n",
    "    2.  **Clean** both datasets to remove noise and validate data quality.\n",
    "    3.  **Process** the text data to generate sentiment scores using VADER and unify all data into a master time-series dataset.\n",
    "    4.  **Analyze** the unified data through a systematic correlation sweep to find the strongest relationships.\n",
    "    5.  **Predict** future price direction using machine learning models built on the most significant findings.\n",
    "This notebook presents the final results and conclusions of that investigation."

    "# \n",
    "# 1.  **Primary Finding:** The investigation uncovered strong, statistically significant evidence that Reddit sentiment acts as a **contrarian indicator** for both BTC and ETH. High levels of positive discussion tend to precede price drops, not rises, suggesting that peak retail excitement often marks a local market top.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2.  **Bitcoin Insight:** The contrarian effect for BTC is most powerful over **long time horizons**. A week of sustained positive sentiment is a strong predictor of a down week to follow. The model's feature importance confirmed this with a massively negative coefficient for sentiment **(-3.088)**, making it the dominant predictive feature.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 3.  **Ethereum Insight:** ETH exhibits this contrarian behavior on a much **shorter, 24-hour timescale**, and the model built for this effect demonstrated a small but genuine predictive edge. The attempt to model a long-term positive signal for ETH was unsuccessful, indicating the contrarian signal is the more reliable one.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### Limitations\n",
    "# These findings are based on a limited dataset of approximately 800 recent, relevant posts due to the constraints of the free Reddit API. While the signals discovered are statistically significant, a more comprehensive dataset covering multiple years and market cycles would be necessary to confirm their robustness. The pipeline built here is fully capable of processing such a dataset if a high-volume API source were utilized."
